## 👨‍⚕️ About Me

I am a Health Data Scientist with a background in **Human Anatomy** and a **Master’s in Public Health**. My work focuses on transforming complex health information into actionable solutions that improve patient outcomes and strengthen healthcare systems with special interest in  **innovation in neurological health**—leveraging Machine Learning and causal inference to understand the distribution and determinants of neurological disorders.

I combine medical knowledge of the nervous system with advanced analytics (Python, R, SQL) to uncover patterns in stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, and mental health outcomes. My goal is to drive evidence-based interventions through data-driven innovation.

### Next Step for You

I noticed you have `readmissiondocumentation.html` linked in your "Projects" section, but I haven't seen the code for that file yet.

**Would you like me to generate a template for that documentation page so it matches the style of your main portfolio?**
